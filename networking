Hosts: 
  Are any devices which sends and recieve traffic over a network e.g computer, laptop, phones, printers, servers, cloudservers, TVs, smartwatches etc
  Client initiate requests, server respond
  Server: Are computer with software  installed which respond to specific requests

IP Address: It is the identity of a host e.g server ip address and destination ip address
  IP Address are 32bites
  Bit = 1 or 0
  Respresented as 4 octets e.g 1000 1000 . 0001 0110 . 0001 0001 . 0110 0010
  Ranges from 0 - 255 e.g 136 . 22 . 17 . 98

Network: It is simply a logical grouping of hosts which requires similar connectivity
  It is what transports traffic between hosts 
  Anytime hosts are connected, you have network
  Network connects to other networks through the internet

Repeaters: Regenerate signals
  Allow communications accross greater distances but this does not scale

Hub: Are simply multi-port repeaters
  Facilitate scaling communication between additional hosts
  Everyone recieves everyone data

Bridge: Sits in between hub-connected hosts
  Bridges only have 2 ports. one connected to one hub connected devices and the other connected to the other hub connected devices
  Bridges learn which hosts are on each side

Switches: Is the process of moving data between networks
  Facilitate communication within a network
  Are a combination of hubs and bridges
  Multiple ports
  Learns which hosts are on each port
  Hosts on a network share thesame IP address space and share thesame network

Router: Is the process of moving data within networks
   Facilitate communication between networks
   Provide traffic control point (security, filtering, redirecting)
   Learn which network they are attached to
   Know as routes stores in a Routing table
   Routing table : All networks a routers knows about
   Gateway: Each host's way out of their local network

Other networking devices: 
   Firewalls
   Load Balancers
   Proxies
   Virtual routers
   Virtual switches
   IDS/ IPS
   Layer 3 switches
   Access points

#OSI Model
   Divided into 7 different parts which are:
   Layer 1 - Physical - Transporting bites
     Computer data exists in the form of bites (1's and 0's)
     Something has to transfer bites between hosts
     L1 Technologies are cables, wifi, repeaters, hubs
   Layer 2 - Data link - Hop to Hop
     Interact with wire (i.e physical layer)
     NIC - Network Interferace card / Wi-Fi Access Cards
     Addressing scheme - MAC addresses
     L2 Technologies are NIC'S, Switches
     often communication between hosts requires multiple hops
   Layer 3 - Network - End to End
     Addressing scheme - IP addresses
     L3 Technologies are Routers, Hosts (anything with an IP)
     ARP - Address Resolution Protocol - links a L3 address to a L2 address
   Layer 4 - Transport - service to service
     Distinguish data streams
     Addressing scheme - ports
     0 - 65535 - TCP - favors reliability
     0 - 65535 - UDP - favors efficiency
     servers listen for requests to predefined ports
     clients select random port for each connection
   Layer 5, 6, and 7 - Session, Presentation, Application - consider as an Application
   
   Sending: Encappsulation - from level 7 to 1
   Recieving: De-Encapsulation - from level 1 to 7
